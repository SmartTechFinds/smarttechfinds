      As a college student, having a clean and functional desk setup makes a huge difference.
      Dorm rooms are small, outlets are limited, and distractions are everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below are some of the best desk accessories that helped me stay organized,
      improve posture, and focus better while studying.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ACCESSORY 1 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>USB-C Hub (Essential for Laptops)</h2>

    <p>
      Most modern laptops don’t have enough ports for everything students need.
      A USB-C hub lets you connect a mouse, keyboard, flash drive, and external monitor
      all at once — perfect for dorm desk setups.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is one of the most useful tech accessories for college students using MacBooks
      or thin Windows laptops.
    </p>

  <!-- ACCESSORY 2 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Laptop Stand (Better Posture & Focus)</h2>

    <p>
      Studying for hours with a laptop flat on your desk can cause neck and back pain.
      A laptop stand raises the screen to eye level and makes long study sessions
      much more comfortable.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is especially helpful in dorm rooms where desk chairs aren’t very ergonomic.
    </p>

  <!-- ACCESSORY 3 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Wireless Mouse (Quiet & Portable)</h2>

    <p>
      Trackpads are fine, but a wireless mouse is faster and more precise —
      especially for long writing sessions, spreadsheets, or coding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Look for a quiet-click mouse so you don’t disturb roommates or people in the library.
    </p>

  <!-- ACCESSORY 4 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Desk Organizer (Small Dorm Friendly)</h2>

    <p>
      A cluttered desk makes it harder to focus. A simple desk organizer keeps
      chargers, pens, notebooks, and small accessories in one place.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is one of the easiest ways to make a dorm desk feel more productive
      without taking up much space.
